## Aim Of The Project

- Nowadays, one of the biggest problems in the world is the uncontrolled destruction of green areas. If we are not careful, it is inevitable that we will see more of this problem in the future.

- Therefore, in this project, the change of vegetation cover in cities, which is one of the many application areas of remote sensing, has been studied in a simple way.

- For this purpose, ssing the satellite images of Istanbul in 2020 and 2017, an analysis was made for the European continent of Istanbul.
